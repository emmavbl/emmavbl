### Hello there 👋

I'm a polyvalent game programmer, fond off UI/UX, accessibility & narrative feature 💁

I worked as 3C programmer on [Assassin's Creed : Mirage](https://www.ubisoft.com/fr-fr/game/assassins-creed/mirage) and I am shipping [Wartales](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527950/Wartales/)' DLC.
